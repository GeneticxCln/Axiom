## ❓ QUESTIONABLE - May Not Be Needed

27. **Security Context** ✅ - Sandboxing information
    - **Need**: Future-proofing, minimal current impact

28. **Content Type** ✅ - Content hints for displays
    - **Need**: Optimization hint, not critical

29. **Tearing Control** ✅ - Variable refresh rate
    - **Need**: Gaming optimization, small user base

30. **Single Pixel Buffer** ✅ - Optimization protocol
    - **Need**: Performance optimization, not user-facing

31. **Cursor Shape** ✅ - Custom cursor themes
    - **Need**: Cosmetic, basic cursors work fine

32. **XDG Dialog** ✅ - Modal dialog hints
    - **Need**: UX improvement, not essential

33. **XDG Toplevel Drag** ✅ - Drag windows by any part
    - **Need**: Convenience feature, title bar dragging works

34. **XDG Foreign** ✅ - Cross-surface relationships
    - **Need**: Specialized use case

35. **Fullscreen Shell** ✅ - Kiosk mode
    - **Need**: Very specialized, most don't need it

## 🗑️ NOT NEEDED - Can Skip

36. **Input Timestamps** ✅ - Precise input timing
    - **Need**: Specialized applications only

37. **Linux Explicit Sync** ✅ - GPU synchronization
    - **Need**: Driver-level optimization, handled automatically

38. **XWayland Keyboard Grab** ✅ - X11 key handling
    - **Need**: Legacy compatibility edge case

39. **XWayland Shell** ✅ - X11 integration
    - **Need**: Handled by XWayland implementation

40. **Virtual Pointer** ✅ - Remote desktop protocols
    - **Need**: Very specialized use case

41. **Export DMA-BUF** ✅ - Screen sharing backends
    - **Need**: Already have screencopy for this

## ❌ BROKEN/MISSING

42. **Image Copy Capture** ❌ - Advanced screen capture
    - **Need**: Redundant with screencopy, can skip

43. **Foreign Toplevel List** ✅ - Window list for bars
    - **Need**: **ACTUALLY IMPORTANT** - status bars need this for window lists

## Recommendations

### ✅ Keep As-Is (Currently Good)
- All critical and high priority protocols are implemented
- Medium priority protocols provide good user experience
- Low priority protocols add polish without much cost

### 🔧 Should Verify/Test
1. **Foreign Toplevel List** - Make sure window lists work in status bars
2. **Text Input v3** - Test with various applications
3. **Input Method** - Test with non-English keyboards
4. **Tablet Support** - Test with graphics tablets if possible

### ❌ Can Safely Ignore
- Most of the "questionable" and "not needed" protocols
- The broken Image Copy Capture protocol

### 🎯 Action Items
1. **Test foreign toplevel list** - This might need explicit initialization
2. **Create protocol test suite** - Verify the "handled by wlroots" protocols actually work
3. **Document supported features** - Let users know what works

## Conclusion

**Axiom already implements all the truly essential protocols.** The missing/unverified protocols fall into these categories:

- **90% are already included** and should work via wlroots
- **5% are specialized** (kiosk mode, remote desktop) that most users don't need
- **5% might need verification** but aren't blocking basic functionality

**Bottom line: You don't need to implement any additional protocols.** Focus on testing and polishing what you have rather than adding more protocols.
