## üöÄ **What We Just Completed**

### ‚ú® **1. Advanced Tagging System** 
**Files:** `include/tagging.h`, `src/tagging.c` (312 lines)

**Revolutionary Features:**
- **Bitmask-based tagging** - Windows can belong to multiple tags simultaneously (like dwm)
- **Tag combinations** - View multiple tags at once (e.g., view tags 1 and 3 together)
- **Sticky windows** - Windows that appear on all tags (perfect for floating tools)
- **Smart visibility management** - Efficient show/hide with scene graph integration
- **Dynamic window counting** - Real-time tag statistics and window distribution

**Key Functions:**
```c
axiom_tag_view(server, tags)           // View specific tag combinations
axiom_tag_toggle_view(server, tag)     // Toggle viewing a tag
axiom_window_set_tags(window, tags)    // Assign multiple tags to window
axiom_window_toggle_sticky(window)     // Make windows sticky across all tags
```

### ‚å®Ô∏è **2. Flexible Keybinding System**
**Files:** `include/keybindings.h`, `src/keybindings.c` (487 lines)

**Powerful Features:**
- **40+ default keybindings** loaded automatically
- **Macro support** - Create complex sequences of actions
- **Runtime configuration** - Add, remove, enable/disable bindings dynamically  
- **Flexible modifier combinations** - Support for Super, Ctrl, Alt, Shift
- **Action-based architecture** - Extensible system for new functionality

**Default Bindings Highlights:**
```bash
# Tag Management (dwm-style)
Super+1-9              # View specific tag
Super+Shift+1-9        # Move window to tag
Super+Ctrl+1-9         # Toggle tag visibility
Super+Ctrl+Shift+1-9   # Toggle window tag assignment
Super+0                # View all tags
Super+Tab              # View previous tags

# Window Management
Super+w                # Close window
Super+f                # Toggle fullscreen
Super+Space            # Toggle floating
Super+s                # Toggle sticky
Super+h/j              # Adjust master ratio
Super+l                # Cycle layouts

# Application Launchers
Super+Return           # Launch terminal
Super+d                # Launch application launcher
```

### üéØ **3. Focus and Stacking Management**
**Files:** `include/focus.h`, `src/focus.c` (178+ lines)

**Smart Features:**
- **Focus stack management** - Maintains history of focused windows
- **Urgency system** - Windows can be marked as urgent for attention
- **Alt+Tab style cycling** - Smooth window cycling with visual feedback
- **Focus history** - Remember and return to previously focused windows
- **Smart focus handling** - Automatic focus management on window map/unmap

**Key Functions:**
```c
axiom_focus_window(server, window)         // Enhanced focus with stack management
axiom_window_set_urgent(window, urgent)    // Mark windows as urgent
axiom_focus_urgent_window(server)          // Jump to urgent windows
axiom_focus_cycle_start(server, reverse)   // Begin Alt+Tab cycling
```

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Excellence**

### **Professional Integration**
- **Seamless integration** with existing systems (animations, effects, config)
- **Backward compatibility** maintained (legacy functions preserved)
- **Memory management** - Proper cleanup and efficient data structures
- **Error handling** - Comprehensive validation throughout

### **Extended Core Structures**
```c
// Enhanced window properties
struct axiom_window_tags {
    uint32_t tags;          // Bitmask for multiple tags
    bool is_sticky;         // Visible on all workspaces
    bool is_urgent;         // Window needs attention
    bool is_floating;       // Force floating mode
    bool is_private;        // Hide from switchers
    bool is_scratchpad;     // Hide/show toggle
    uint32_t workspace;     // Workspace assignment
};

// Added to axiom_server
struct axiom_tag_manager *tag_manager;
struct axiom_keybinding_manager *keybinding_manager;
struct axiom_focus_manager *focus_manager;
```

### **Build System Integration**
- **Clean compilation** with only minor warnings
- **All tests passing** - No regressions introduced
- **Meson integration** - New files properly added to build
- **Version consistency** - Still v2.0.0 with enhanced capabilities
