# Hardcoded Values Replacement Summary

This document summarizes the completion of Phase 1.1 of the Axiom roadmap: "Remove hardcoded values - Replace magic numbers with named constants."

## Overview

Successfully replaced hardcoded numeric values throughout the Axiom codebase with named constants, improving code maintainability, readability, and configuration management.

## Files Modified

### Header Files
- **`include/constants.h`** - Enhanced with comprehensive named constants
  - Window dimensions and positioning constants
  - Animation duration constants for different window states
  - Configuration parsing limits
  - Input and cursor defaults
  - Workspace and display constants
  - UI element dimensions
  - Memory and buffer sizes
  - Effects and graphics constants
  - Performance and limits
  - And many more categorized constants

### Source Files Updated
1. **`src/main.c`** - Previously updated with window positioning constants
2. **`src/errors.c`** - Replaced hardcoded window and workspace dimensions
3. **`src/config.c`** - Replaced input, animation, and configuration parsing constants
4. **`src/window_snapping.c`** - Replaced animation and timing constants
5. **`src/smart_gaps.c`** - Replaced animation duration and fallback dimension constants

## Key Constants Added

### Window and Display Constants
- `AXIOM_DEFAULT_WINDOW_WIDTH` (800)
- `AXIOM_DEFAULT_WINDOW_HEIGHT` (600)
- `AXIOM_DEFAULT_WINDOW_X` (100)
- `AXIOM_DEFAULT_WINDOW_Y` (100)
- `AXIOM_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_WIDTH` (1920)
- `AXIOM_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_HEIGHT` (1080)

### Animation Constants
- `AXIOM_ANIMATION_DURATION_FAST` (150ms)
- `AXIOM_ANIMATION_DURATION_NORMAL` (200ms)
- `AXIOM_ANIMATION_DURATION_SLOW` (300ms)
- `AXIOM_ANIMATION_WINDOW_APPEAR_DURATION` (300ms)
- `AXIOM_ANIMATION_WINDOW_DISAPPEAR_DURATION` (200ms)
- `AXIOM_ANIMATION_WINDOW_MOVE_DURATION` (250ms)
- `AXIOM_ANIMATION_WINDOW_RESIZE_DURATION` (200ms)
- `AXIOM_ANIMATION_WORKSPACE_DURATION` (400ms)
- `AXIOM_ANIMATION_FOCUS_RING_DURATION` (150ms)
- `AXIOM_ANIMATION_LAYOUT_CHANGE_DURATION` (300ms)

### Configuration Constants
- `AXIOM_CONFIG_MAX_LINE_LENGTH` (512)
- `AXIOM_CONFIG_MAX_SECTION_LENGTH` (64)
- `AXIOM_DEFAULT_CURSOR_SIZE` (24)
- `AXIOM_DEFAULT_REPEAT_RATE` (25)
- `AXIOM_DEFAULT_REPEAT_DELAY` (600)

### Layout and Spacing
- `AXIOM_DEFAULT_GAP_SIZE` (10)
- `AXIOM_WORKSPACE_SWITCH_DELAY_MS` (100)

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Maintainability**: All magic numbers are now centralized in `constants.h`
2. **Better Readability**: Code is self-documenting with descriptive constant names
3. **Easier Configuration**: Constants can be easily modified in one location
4. **Consistency**: Same values are guaranteed across all usage sites
5. **Type Safety**: Compile-time constants prevent runtime errors

## Build Status

- ✅ **Build**: All source files compile successfully
- ✅ **Tests**: All 8 test suites pass (basic, window_rules, thumbnail_manager, config, animation_config, effects, pip_manager, animation)
- ✅ **Integration**: No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Validation

The replacement was validated through:
1. Successful compilation of all source files
2. All existing tests continue to pass
3. No functional changes - only replacing literal values with equivalent named constants
4. Comprehensive grep analysis to identify and address all relevant hardcoded values

## Next Steps

This completes the "Remove hardcoded values" task from Phase 1.1 of the roadmap. The codebase now has a solid foundation of named constants that will support:

1. Future configuration system enhancements
2. Theme and appearance customization
3. Performance tuning and optimization
4. Better error handling and validation
5. Continued code maintainability improvements

The next recommended tasks from the roadmap would be:
- Continue with memory management improvements
- Add proper error handling throughout the codebase using the new error system
- Implement configuration validation using the new constants
