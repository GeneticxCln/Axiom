workspace = 2
size = 1200x800
position = center

[mpv]
floating = true
size = 640x480
position = bottom-right

[calculator]

size = 300x400
position = top-right
```

## ü™ü Window Management

### Tagging System

Axiom uses a powerful tagging system inspired by dwm:

**What are tags?**
- Tags are like workspaces but more flexible
- Windows can belong to multiple tags simultaneously
- You can view multiple tags at once

**Tag Operations:**
```bash
# View tag 1
Super+1

# Move current window to tag 2
Super+Shift+2

# View both tags 1 and 3
Super+1, then Super+Ctrl+3

# Make window appear on tags 1 and 2
Super+Shift+1, then Super+Ctrl+Shift+2
```

### Layout Modes

1. **Master-Stack** (default)
   - One large master area on the left
   - Stack of windows on the right
   - Adjustable master ratio

2. **Grid**
   - Windows arranged in a grid pattern
   - Automatically adjusts based on window count

3. **Spiral**
   - Windows arranged in a spiral pattern
   - Visually appealing for many windows

4. **Binary Tree**
   - Hierarchical window arrangement
   - Efficient space utilization

### Floating Windows

Some windows work better as floating:
- Calculators, dialogs, popup windows
- Use `Super+space` to toggle floating mode
- Floating windows can be moved and resized normally

### Sticky Windows

Sticky windows appear on all tags:
- Perfect for monitoring tools, chat applications
- Use `Super+s` to toggle sticky mode
- Appears regardless of current tag selection

## üñ•Ô∏è Multi-Monitor Setup

### Automatic Detection

Axiom automatically detects connected monitors and configures them appropriately.

### Per-Monitor Configuration

Each monitor has independent:
- Tiling engine and layout
- Workspace/tag management
- Window arrangements
- Configuration settings

### Monitor Commands

```bash
# Move window to specific monitor
# (Use mouse or window rules)

# Configure monitor in rules.conf
[work-monitor]
output = "DP-1"
workspace = 1
position = left

[media-monitor]
output = "HDMI-1" 
workspace = 9
position = right
```

### Workspace Distribution

- Each monitor can have its own active tags
- Windows can be moved between monitors
- Consistent keybindings work across all monitors

## üé® Effects and Theming

### Visual Effects

**Shadows:**
- Configurable blur radius and offset
- Custom shadow colors and opacity
- GPU-accelerated rendering

**Blur:**
- Gaussian blur for unfocused windows
- Configurable blur radius and intensity
- Two-pass blur for optimal quality

**Transparency:**
- Focus-based opacity changes
- Separate settings for focused/unfocused/inactive
- Smooth transitions

**Animations:**
- Window appear/disappear animations
- Workspace switching animations
- Multiple easing functions available

### Performance Settings

```ini
[effects]
# Disable effects for better performance
shadows_enabled = false
blur_enabled = false
transparency_enabled = false

# Or reduce quality
shadow_blur_radius = 5    # Lower = faster
blur_radius = 8          # Lower = faster
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Compositor won't start:**
```bash
# Check dependencies
axiom --version

# Run with debug output
axiom --debug --nested

# Check Wayland socket
echo $WAYLAND_DISPLAY
```

**Performance issues:**
```bash
# Disable effects temporarily
# Edit ~/.config/axiom/axiom.conf
[effects]
shadows_enabled = false
blur_enabled = false

# Check GPU acceleration
glxinfo | grep "direct rendering"
```

**Keybindings not working:**
```bash
# Check configuration syntax
axiom --check-config

# Reload configuration
Super+r
```

**Applications not launching:**
```bash
# Ensure environment variables are set
echo $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
echo $WAYLAND_DISPLAY

# For X11 apps, ensure XWayland is working
xwininfo  # Should work in Axiom
```

### Log Files

Check logs for debugging:
```bash
# System logs
journalctl -u axiom

# Session logs (if using display manager)
~/.xsession-errors
```

# Reduce animation complexity
speed_multiplier = 2.0    # Faster animations
window_animations = false # Disable if needed

[effects]
# Optimize for older hardware
shadow_blur_radius = 5
blur_radius = 8
```

### Hardware Requirements

**Minimum:**
- OpenGL ES 2.0 support
- 2GB RAM
- Any modern GPU (Intel HD, AMD, NVIDIA)

**Recommended:**
- OpenGL ES 3.0 support  
- 4GB+ RAM
- Dedicated GPU for best effects performance

   - Tag 2: Code editor
   - Tag 3: Terminal
   - Tag 4: Documentation

2. **Media Workflow:**
   - Tag 8: Media player (sticky)
   - Tag 9: File manager

### Advanced Configuration

```ini
# Fine-tune master ratio for your workflow
[tiling]
master_ratio = 0.7  # Larger main window

# Customize gaps for your preference
[smart_gaps]
base_gap = 15       # More breathing room
single_window_gap = 5  # Small gap for single windows

# Optimize animations for your hardware
[animations]
window_appear_duration = 200  # Faster appearance
workspace_switch_duration = 300  # Smooth switching
```
