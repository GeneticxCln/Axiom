### Integration Points
- **Rule Engine Integration**: Hook into window creation/focus events
- **Gap System Integration**: Extend tiling engine with gap calculations
- **Snapping Integration**: Hook into cursor motion and window dragging
- **Thumbnail Integration**: Connect to visual effects and GPU rendering
- **Configuration Integration**: Expand config system for new options

## üîß Dependencies

### Required Libraries
- **Existing**: All Phase 2 dependencies (OpenGL ES, EGL, wlroots)
